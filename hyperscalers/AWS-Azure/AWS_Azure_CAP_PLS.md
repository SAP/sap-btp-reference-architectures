## **Secure Connectivity with SAP Private Link service**

Private Link Service is a feature offered by cloud providers like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows customers to expose their services in their virtual networks to consumers in other virtual networks or subscriptions. The primary goal of Private Link Service is to ensure that data offered by service providers is only accessible through a private endpoint, which ensures that the data doesn't traverse over the public internet.

SAP Private Link Service service allows to securely connect applications running on SAP BTP to workloads running on hyperscalers. This ensures that traffic is not routed through the public internet but stays within the hyperscaler infrastructure. This helps to minimize attack vectors and ensures secure communication between SAP BTP and hyperscaler workload. To use Private Link Service, service providers would set up a standard Load Balancer in front of their service in Azure and then enable Private Link Service on one or more standard public IP addresses. Consumers, on the other hand, would create a private endpoint in their virtual network and connect it to the service provider's service.

More details about [SAP Private Link Service ](https://help.sap.com/docs/PRIVATE_LINK?locale=en-US).

### Flow
To establish the private connection, you first need create a service instance of the SAP Private Link service by providing the identifier of the IaaS provider service instance. After approving the creation of the private endpoint in your IaaS provider account, you bind the service instance to your application and can then start using the private endpoint.

However, this binding does not include any credentials for accessing the service in your own IaaS account. You need to provide the credentials to your application by different means, for example, by creating a user-provided service that contains the required information, and binding it to the application.

**Service Identifier**: The unique identifier of a service instance of an IaaS provider service that has to be provided during the creation of the SAP Private Link service instance. The actual term depends on the IaaS provider, for example, in Azure, this unique service identifier is called service resource.
   
**Service Instance**: Creating a service instance of the SAP Private Link service sets up a private endpoint that is associated with this service instance.

**Binding**: Binding the service instance of the SAP Private Link service to the application gives the Cloud Foundry space access to the private endpoint. Binding the user-provided service to the application shares the service credentials with the application.

**Credentials**: Creating a user-provided service, for example, enables you to share the credentials of the bound service instance in the IaaS provider account with the application in your SAP BTP account.

### Characteristics
Currently SAP Private Link service supports private endpoints on Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. Supported services from each of the vendors are as follows:
- [Supported Microsoft Azure services](https://help.sap.com/docs/private-link/private-link1/consume-azure-services-in-sap-btp): To privately access a service in your Azure subcription, SAP Private Link service creates a private endpoint and reuses the private link functionality of Azure. 
- [Supported AWS services](https://help.sap.com/docs/private-link/private-link1/consume-amazon-web-services-in-sap-btp): To privately access a service in your AWS subcription, SAP Private Link service creates a private endpoint and reuses the private link functionality of AWS. 

### Examples in an SAP Context
The most commonly used use case for SAP Private Link service is to communicate with an SAP S/4HANA system or other SAP or non-SAP systems running on a VM in your own Microsoft Azure or AWS account privately from within SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment.

This connection can be established by creating a hyperscaler Endpoint Service that exposes a Load Balancer which routes traffic to the SAP S/4HANA system. The service name of that Endpoint Service must then be used to create an SAP Private Link service instance. As soon as the connection is established successfully, the SAP Private Link service provides a private hostname pointing to your Endpoint Service.

You can also find an end-to-end SAP S/4HANA extension use case with step-by-step instructions, both for AWS and Azure, in this use case titled [Enhance core ERP business processes with resilient applications on SAP BTP](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-build-resilient-apps).

The second use case is to use the service name of one of the supported services offered by AWS instead of a custom service name. The basic functionality is the same, but instead of a connection to a custom endpoint exposed via an AWS Endpoint Service, the connection will be established to a service natively provided by AWS, such as the Amazon Simple Queue Service.
